## Task 1: General Questions

### 1.	What is your preferred language when building predictive models and why? 
When building a predictive model, I would say both Python and R are good tools to build a model. Personally, I would prefer using Python to build a predictive model. Python has provided extensive libraries for machine learning models, and it is a very versatile language compared to R (while R required steeper learning curve for someone that is new to it). Moreover, you can easily find resources online when you face problem using Python. 

### 2.	Provide an example of when you used SQL to extract data.
I gained most of my SQL knowledge during the first semester of my master’s program. My most recent application of SQL was in a team project during the Fall of 2023. This project, sponsored by the Oakland County Office in Michigan, involved using the Snowflake platform to access their database. We used both Python and SQL to interact with the data. My team and I specifically utilized SQL to categorize the database into different groups based on specific characteristics and to create a common identifier for future retrieval.

### 3.	Give an example of a situation where you disagreed upon an idea or solution design with a co-worker.  How did you handle the case? 
During my internship last summer, I found myself collaborating with a colleague who is also a friend from my master’s program. Together, we were tasked with building a classification model to help the company sort its current and future data. In the early stages of development, we encountered several disagreements about how to approach the model. I suggested that we each test our own concepts before our next meeting and then compare the designs for efficiency and accuracy. He agreed, and this approach proved effective for us. Additionally, when we shared our designs, we also discussed our concerns and suggestions with each other. This method was extremely helpful during the early stages of code development, allowing us to brainstorm more thoroughly and improve both our design. In the end, the final model used a portion of our design 

### 4.	What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses and how will these affect your performance here?
In term of my greatest strengths, I would say that I am very analytical and detail-oriented. I enjoy diving into complex problems and finding solutions that are both effective and efficient, and when I do so, I will easily lose the track of time. This means I can quickly grasp and solve challenging issues, which will contribute to high-quality and timely outcomes for the team. Moreover, I am also very good at working in a team environment and working with other people to work on a project. This help me to ensures smooth project workflows and a positive, cooperative atmosphere. 

In terms of weaknesses, public speaking is an area where I have room for improvement. However, I am actively working on this by practicing with friends and colleagues. While I may not be the most confident speaker initially, my commitment to improving this skill shows my dedication to personal and professional growth. I am confident that with continued effort, I will become a more effective communicator, which will further enhance my contributions to the team and organization.
